PROJECT TITLE:Cruz Azul Logo
PURPOSE OF PROJECT:Remake the Cruz Azul Logo using StdDraw
VERSION or DATE: 8/23/2020
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:I began with the easiest parts of the logo such as, the circles, squares, and rectangles.
AUTHORS:Yi Qian Goh
USER INSTRUCTIONS:To make this logo I used StdDraw to get the basic shapes first (circle, square, rectangle, text). 
To make the stars at the top half of the cruz azul logo, I took apart the star shape so that I would only need to 
find 7 points rather than 11. My star is composed of an arrow shape, which is essentially an isosceles triangle with
an indent at the base of it, and an upside down obtuse triangle. The indent of the isosceles triangle and the largest
angle of the obtuse triangle stick together, and when one triangle is laid on top of the other it makes a five point
star. Then, to rotate the stars I created a rotate method.
